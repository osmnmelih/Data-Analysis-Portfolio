I conducted an Independent Samples T-test using a dataset of ~3,000 math practice attempts to evaluate how learners progress from early to late-stage mastery.

Key Scientific Findings:

Statistical Significance: The analysis yielded a p-value of p<0.001, indicating that learning gains between early sessions (1-5) and late sessions (11-15) are highly significant.

Instructional Efficiency: Developed a custom Efficiency Score (Success Rate / Time) to identify cognitive bottlenecks.

Cognitive Load Insight: Found that Multiplication has an efficiency score of 3.19, significantly lower than Subtraction (11.00), suggesting a higher demand on working memory.

The following Learning Curve visualizes the evolution of the success rate across 15 practice sessions:

🛠️ Technical Implementation
Statistical Analysis: SciPy (Levene's Test, Independent T-tests, Confidence Intervals).

Data Processing: Pandas and NumPy for large-scale behavioral data cleaning.

Visualization: Matplotlib and Seaborn for high-resolution research plotting.

Reporting: Rich library for professional CLI-based data summaries.
